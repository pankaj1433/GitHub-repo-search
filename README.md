# Bally’s Coding Test

Create a single page web application that utilises GitHub APIs to allow a user to search for a
repository by name. The application should also offer a detailed view for viewing more
information about a repository. This detailed view should include the repository’s readme, if
available, and the number of open issues, number of forks, etc.

## Install Dependencies

npm install
```

## Setup .env file
Paste following token in your env file:
```
```

```
npm run dev
```
To build production app:

```

## Sample Sitemap

/ ==> Home Page

/search-results ==> Search result page

/search/repo-detail ==> repo detail page

## Requirements

- The application should utilise best practices for any TypeScript, CSS and HTML that
you write.
- The application must be written using TypeScript
- You should use a CSS framework (e.g. MUI, Bootstrap, etc.) to provide the base
styles for your application. We use MUI at Bally’s, and encourage you to also use it in
this application, although if you feel more comfortable in another framework, we will
accept that.
- You must use React
- Your codebase should include a .gitignore file that excludes third-party code you’re
using but didn’t write yourself
- The submitted application must be the complete solution, with code
- Please provide instructions, if you feel they’re necessary
- Please test your application and ensure it works as expected, include credentials that
will work with the api’s if you need to.
- Use your initiative wherever possible, and have fun with it.
